lscpu | grep -E '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('

CPU(s):                16
Thread(s) per core:    2
Core(s) per socket:    4
Socket(s):             2

Two physical sockets, each containing a chip with 4 physical cores, making 8 cores total. 
Two threads get to issue instructions to each core (this machine has hyperthreading), 
meaning there must be two CPUs attached to each core, making a total of 8 * 2 = 16 CPUs
